## The Process of Communication
### Definition
The delivery and reception of information with a goal of minimizing distractions/distortions during the process of propagation by the sender and interpretation by the receiver.

### Channels

**Strategic Conversation** begins with the end in mind, ie. formulate a "take away" message by thinking through the impact you want to have on the receiver.

1. **Open Communication:** what information you have to give (recognize my credibility)
2. **Effective Listening:** is the message being understood (listen loudly)
3. **Discernment:** how we perceive/judge information received (correct perception)
4. **Dialog:** gain a shared vision/agreement/emotional tie (mind + heart)
5. **Body Language:** alignment with message (effective utilization)

### Formal Communication
* **Stages of Communication** (low-end to high-end of channel "richness")
  * **Level 1:** Reports
  * **Level 2:** Memos, Instant Messaging
  * **Level 3:** Voice Call, Face-to-Face

### Informal Communication
* Personal Hand-Written Letter
* Social Media

## Communication Styles
### Putting Yourself in the Shoes of the Receiver
* How the recipient may optimally assimilate the information
  * Verbal
  * Written
* How much information to convey to the receiver
  * High-level summary
  * Low-level details
* How often the receiver wants to hear from you
  * Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly

### Listening Loudly
One of them most effective means of communication since it provides real-time feedback for the sender to understand if the receiver is properly interpreting the message.

* **Empathic Listening:** hearing the words that are *not* being said
  * Reading between the lines
  * Hearing the emotion/voice (true intention of the message)
    * ie. Less direct communication is inferred
* **Listening Loudly:** you cannot be thinking about what you want to say next while simultaneously listening to what the other person is currently saying
  * Need to be present and mindful of what's going on in your own head
  * Take notes of what the other person is saying (corresponding with emotional annotations)
    * Paraphrase back what was said, so the sender feels heard
* **Questions:**
  * Close-ended: quick, objective response (yes or no)
  * Open-ended: inviting somebody to share thoughts (engaging / thinking / perception)

2. **Thinkers**
  * Difficult decision makers to convince since they want an argument that's very well supported by data
  * Take time to make the decision (may need to provide data more than once in multiple ways)
3. **Skeptics**
  * Always look at the "half empty" perspective
  * Suspicious about new ways of thinking, particularly if it challenges their own mental models and their own way of thinking and their own view of the world
  * Always find the reason "why not"
  * Though, take charge person who may need significant additional information

Knowing when to be silent or not.
